The process begins with pre-processing tasks such as scaling the data to ensure uniform ranges and identifying/removing outliers to enhance the quality of the results. The next step involves determining the optimal number of cluster centers using automated tools like NBclust, Elbow, Gap statistics, and silhouette methods. These tools provide insights into the appropriate number of clusters based on different evaluation metrics. Once the ideal number of clusters is determined, k-means clustering analysis is performed using all input variables. The resulting output includes information about the cluster centers, clustered results, and evaluation metrics like the ratio of between-cluster sums of squares (BSS) to total sum of squares (TSS), as well as within-cluster sums of squares (WSS) indices. Furthermore, a silhouette plot is generated to assess the quality of the obtained clusters by measuring the closeness of points within and across clusters. The average silhouette width score is calculated, providing an indication of the clustering performance.
